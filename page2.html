            <h2>Taylor Swift</h2>
            <h3>Fun Facts about the Artist</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ranked at Number 2 in Spotify </li>
                <li>Has broken 118 Guinness World Records! </li>
                <li>Has 60 million subscribers in Youtube</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Taylor Swift, in an interview for Vogue's September issue, discussed her experiences with sexism in the music industry. Initially, as a teenager, 
                Swift didn't notice the unfair treatment, attributing this to being perceived 
                as a child by industry men. However, as she matured and her success became 
                more formidable, attitudes shifted. Swift highlighted the infantilization 
                of her early success and the changing perceptions when she started playing 
                stadiums and was seen as a woman. Supporting research indicates that women 
                in the workplace face similar challenges, with men feeling threatened by 
                female managers and women needing to prove their competence more. Swift 
                also criticized the double standards in songwriting, where men aren't judged 
                for using personal relationships as inspiration. Her upcoming album, "Lover," 
                includes a song titled "The Man," which addresses these feminist themes, imagining
                 how she would be perceived if she were a man.</p>

            <h2>Nicki Minaj</h2>
            <h3>Fun Facts about the Artist</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ranked at Number 57 in Spotify </li>
                <li>Has a tattoo in Chinese on her left arm meaning "God is with me always"</li> 
                <li>More of a Dog Lover than a Cat Lover</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Nicki Minaj recently addressed sexism in the music industry on Twitter, prompted 
                by rapper Russ's call for more respect for her. Retweeting Russ's video, Nicki 
                highlighted the double standards women face, asserting that they must work twice 
                as hard for half the recognition men receive. She questioned why male artists frequently 
                collaborate with each other but often only work with women under pressure, referencing 
                her own collaborations. Nicki criticized the industry for diminishing her decade of success 
                and pointed to a 2013 tweet by Kendrick Lamar, who noted the disproportionate animosity towards 
                her from men, to underscore her point. Nicki's candid reflections emphasize the need for the music 
                industry to support and respect female artists.</p>

            <h2>Bjork</h2>
            <h3>Fun Facts about the Artist</h3>

                <li>The name "Bjork" means birch, the tree</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In an open letter to the media, Björk addresses the sexism female artists face regarding how their work is 
                received. Following critiques of her DJ sets at Houston's Day For Night Festival for "hiding" behind desks, 
                she highlights the double standards that don't apply to male DJs. Björk argues that women in music are often 
                confined to singing about relationships, while men have the freedom to explore diverse topics without criticism. 
                She recounts how her albums Volta and Biophilia, which tackled unconventional subjects, faced media resistance 
                until Vulnicura, where she sang about heartbreak. Björk calls for 2017 to be a year of transformation, advocating 
                for the right to artistic variety for women.</p>

                disrespected, ignored, and cyber-bullied for calling out discrimination. She observes how men in the industry often 
                discredit her and others, despite progress in attitudes towards artists' mental health. Sawayama highlights the misuse 
                of mental health rhetoric to disguise misogyny and calls for systemic change. She urges more voices to speak against the 
                persistent racism and sexism, advocating for a shift from competition to community among female artists to create a safer, 
                fairer industry for future generations.</p>

                and relentless sexual harassment from a senior male crew member. Despite her excitement about exploring the music industry,
